# impress-vue

Re-invented impress.js with vue.  :smiley

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Add a new scene

1. Go to the `/src/slides` folder
2. Add your own scene with markdown
3. Edit `slides/index.js` to config your scene
4. build and run the site 

## TODOs

- [ ] The `slides` folder is a mess, I'll make it cleaner later.
- [ ] I don't like 3D slides... So 3D effects is not included, maybe to add later.
- [ ] Now, `overview` need a implicit register. I'll make it a generated scene later.
- [ ] Comments as doc.
