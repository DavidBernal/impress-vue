## Add a new scene

1. Go to the `/src/slides` folder
2. Add your own scene with markdown
3. Edit `slides/index.js` to config your scene
4. build and run the site 

## TODOs

[x] The `slides` folder is a mess, I'll make it cleaner later.
[x] I don't like 3D slides... So 3D effects is not included, maybe to add later.
[x] Now, `overview` need a implicit register. I'll make it a generated scene later.
[x] Comments as doc.
